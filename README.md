# Privacy Policy for "Send Magnet to uTorrent"

This extension stores user-provided uTorrent WebUI credentials (IP address, port, username, and password) locally using Chrome's `storage.sync` API. This data is used solely to authenticate and communicate with the user's own uTorrent WebUI instance.

No data is transmitted to any third-party servers. The extension does not collect, track, or share any personal or usage data.

All communication occurs directly between the browser and the userâ€™s uTorrent WebUI over the local network.
